 # StaNExus White Hat Terminal App
 
  A simulated command-line interface Flutter application designed for educational purposes
  to demonstrate common ethical hacking phases and concepts: reconnaissance, vulnerability
  scanning, and reporting. This application *does not* perform real-world hacking activities
  or interact with actual network services. All "findings" and "results" are pre-defined
  simulations for learning.

  ## Features
  - **Simulated Ethical Hacking Workflow:** Follows a structured approach (Reconnaissance, Vulnerability Scanning, Reporting).
  - **Interactive Terminal Interface:** A retro-themed terminal UI with command input and scrolling output.
  - **Phase-Based Commands:** Commands become available as you progress through the simulated assessment phases.
  - **Dynamic Output:** Simulated results and guidance are displayed in the terminal.
  - **Customizable Theme:** Uses Google Fonts (Fira Code) and a custom color scheme for a realistic terminal feel.
 
  ## Getting Started
 
  ### Prerequisites
  - [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (version 3.x.x or higher recommended)
  - A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or Android Studio
 
  ### Installation
 
  1. **Clone the repository:**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Stanley-blik/StaNExus-White-Hat-Terminal-App.git
     cd StaNExus-White-Hat-Terminal-App
     ```
 
  2. **Install dependencies:**
     ```bash
     flutter pub get
     ```
 
  3. **Run the application:**
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
     This will launch the app on your connected device or emulator.
 
  ## Usage
 
  Upon launching the application, you will be greeted by a splash screen, followed by the main terminal interface.
  
  ### Initial Setup
  The terminal will prompt you to set a target URL.
  - To begin a new assessment, type: `set_target <URL>` (e.g., `set_target example.com`)
 
  ### Navigating Phases
  The application guides you through different phases:
  1.  **Awaiting Target:** Set your target URL.
  2.  **Reconnaissance:** Gather information about the target.
  3.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Identify potential weaknesses.
  4.  **Reporting:** Generate a summary of your findings.
 
  To advance to the next phase, type: `next_phase`
 
  ### Common Commands
  - `help`: Displays available commands for the current phase.
  - `clear`: Clears the terminal output.
  - `exit`: Ends the current assessment session and resets the terminal.
 
  ### Phase-Specific Commands (Examples)
  **Reconnaissance Phase:**
  - `recon_dns`: Simulate DNS enumeration.
  - `recon_whois`: Simulate Whois lookup.
  - `recon_ports`: Simulate basic port scanning.
  - `recon_subdomains`: Simulate subdomain enumeration.
 
  **Vulnerability Scanning Phase:**
  - `vuln_xss`: Simulate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) check.
  - `vuln_sql`: Simulate SQL Injection (SQLi) check.
  - `vuln_dirb`: Simulate directory/file brute-forcing.
  - `vuln_headers`: Analyze HTTP security headers.
 
  **Reporting Phase:**
  - `generate_report`: Compile and display a summary of all findings.
 
  Experiment with different commands and observe the simulated results. Remember, the findings are randomized or based on simple string checks (e.g., if target URL contains 'testphp' or 'sqli') for demonstration purposes.
